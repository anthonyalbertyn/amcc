and validation as per brief.

See document in /brief directory for more details.

## Technology use

This project was built on create-react-app with React and JavaScript.

This project has not been checked cross-browser so for best
results use a modern version of Chrome.

Open Chrome browser and visist to http://localhost:3000

## Tests

There are no tests at the moment as I am out of time, but
in future I will come back and write some unit tests.

To see some tests that I wrote for a different project,
